"""Which glyph a mutation is drawn as, and what the three shades mean.

The glyph is the mutation's *type*, read from the columns the annotator promotes rather than
from any display string: `mutation_type` (breseq's three letters), `snp_type` (the functional
class of a base substitution) and `mutation_category` (which already applies breseq's 50 bp
large/small cutoff). The shade is decided per gene in `analysis.py`, because one deletion can
knock out one gene and merely clip the tail of the next.

Every name here is a `<symbol id="mr-<glyph>">` in `templates/recurrent/_glyphs.html`;
`GLYPHS` is the legend's order and the test that every glyph has a symbol.
